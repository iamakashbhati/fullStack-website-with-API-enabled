# fullStack-website-with-API-enabled

I have prepared a Full-Stack website with REST API to show current date,time along with POST request to send the details from client to
localhost server for database collection.

For database collection follow the following steps:

1) Install Xampp.
2) Start Apache and MySQL.
3) Now copy the above folder in "htdocs".
4) Open browser and visit : localhost/<folder_name> for main page.
5) Now visit : localhost/phpmyadmin and create "user2" table in "loginsystem".
6) Come back to main page and now you can check for current time and enter all the deatils in query section, followed by clicking "submit".
   (OPTIONAL)
7) Refresh the "localhost/phpmyadmin" page to update the database with recently entered query.
